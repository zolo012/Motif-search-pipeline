# Motif-search-pipeline

In this repository there are functions that can find putative motifs in proteins by using regular expressions (RegEx) or position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) generated from already knowns motifs in interaction partners of a given protein. Then these candidates are filtered based on IuPred, Pfam, location, evolution and protein-protein interaction (PPI) data.
